    date = extractor.extract_date()
    if date:
        formatted_date = extractor.convert_date(date)
        print("Date:", formatted_date)
    else:
        print("No date found")

    # Extract and convert the time
    times = extractor.extract_time()
    if times:
        for time in times:
            formatted_time = extractor.convert_time(time)
            print("Time:", formatted_time)
    else:
        print("No time found")

    # Extract URLs
    urls = extractor.extract_url()
    if urls:
